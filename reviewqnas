Short Answer & Definitions:
1. Q: What is a race condition ?

   A: A race condition occurs 2+ threads update a shared part of memory
at the same time due to improper synchronization leading to non-determintistic behaviour.

2. Q: Critical Section

   A: A critical section is a part of a program where a shared resource is accessed and must be executed by only one thread at a time to prevent race conditions.

3. Q: Deadlock

   A: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources, causing a cycle where no thread can proceed

4. Q: Process Synchronization (Barriers/Semaphore, etc.)
   A: Process synchronization ensures that multiple processes or threads execute in a coordinated manner to prevent race conditions and ensure correct execution. It uses mechanisms like barriers (forcing threads to wait until all reach a point) and semaphores (signals to control resource access).
