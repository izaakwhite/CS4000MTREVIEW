Short Answer & Definitions:
1. Q: What is a race condition ?

   A: A race condition occurs 2+ threads update a shared part of memory
at the same time due to improper synchronization leading to non-determintistic behaviour.

2. Q: Critical Section

   A: A critical section is a part of a program where a shared resource is accessed and must be executed by only one thread at a time to prevent race conditions.

3. Q: Deadlock

   A: A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are waiting for each other to release resources, causing a cycle where no thread can proceed

4. Q: Process Synchronization (Barriers/Semaphore, etc.)
   A: Process synchronization ensures that multiple processes or threads execute in a coordinated manner to prevent race conditions and ensure correct execution. It uses mechanisms like barriers (forcing threads to wait until all reach a point) and semaphores (signals to control resource access).

5. Thread Safety
Thread safety ensures that shared data is accessed and modified correctly when multiple threads execute concurrently, preventing race conditions and undefined behavior.

6. Amdahl’s Law
Amdahl’s Law states that the speedup of a program using multiple processors is limited by the portion of the program that remains sequential.

7. Efficiency
Efficiency in parallel computing measures how well computational resources are utilized.

8. Speedup
Speedup measures performance improvement when using multiple processors

9. OpenMP Environment Variables
OpenMP uses environment variables to control execution. 

10. Concurrent Computing
A computing model where multiple tasks overlap in execution but may not run simultaneously. Tasks share resources and can be interleaved.

11. Parallel Computing
A model where multiple tasks run simultaneously on different processors or cores, dividing work for faster execution.

12. Distributed Computing
A model where multiple independent computers (nodes) communicate over a network to complete a task collaboratively, often used in large-scale computing.
